Hi, I'm Quang Nguyen. 

This is my interviewing test with gapo, an simple web app to manage users infomation. 
This app focus in frontend with ReactJs, using no frontend package but styled component,
besides, it need a backend server to send requests and get responses, so i built a simple server by nodeJs, too.

So let's start with 3 simple step to run the app:
  1. Just turn on the command promp and run the command line that everyone know: "npm install".
  2. After that, run "node server" to start NodeJs server.
     A json file name data.json is used to store data.
  3. Turn on another command promp and run "npm start run" to start React app.

And here we go. Thank you for spend your precious time, and have a nice day!
